## Description

The aim of this project is to simulate a hydroelectric production system, the collection of data to the operation of the turbines.


Dynamic programming uses the total throughput calculated by short-term optimisation to determine the turbinated unit start by each of the turbines. A user interface will allow us to visualize the turbines in operation based on the result of the algorithm.

## Requirement

- Python 3
