## Description

The aim of this project is to simulate a hydroelectric production system, the collection of data to the operation of the turbines.


Dynamic programming uses the total throughput calculated by short-term optimization to determine the turbinated unit start by each of the turbines. A user interface will allow to visualize the turbines in operation according to the result of the algorithm.

## Requirement
